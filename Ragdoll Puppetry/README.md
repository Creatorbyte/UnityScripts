### Disclaimer ###
The scripts in this folder are included to illustrate the system I used for the ragdoll puppetry and combat system in [this game](https://fishlicka.itch.io/schwing).

### Contents ###
Ragdollifier - Attaches capsule colliders to a rigged model imported from blender. Colliders will require adjustment.
Walker - Animates a ragdoll to walk by applying forces to the head and feet.

Combat/Monster - Attach to top level of ragdolled armature to detect hits by player.wbody.
Combat/Hittable - Attached by Monster script to each part of ragdoll with a collider.
Combat/Weapon - Controlled by Player script to emit particles on Monster hit

### Combat System Layermask Scheme ###
For weapon-monster collision identification, the scripts in the Combat folder adhere to the following layerMask scheme:
Monsters are on layermask 10
Weapon is on layermask 9
